                <h2 class="section-title" style="color: var(--navy);">Our Story</h2>
                <div class="gold-line"></div>
                <p>The James Kenechukwu Onwubalili Foundation was established in July 2023 by the family of Dr. James Kenechukwu Onwubalili to honour his extraordinary legacy and continue his lifelong commitment to educational excellence.</p>
                <p>Dr. JK believed passionately that education was the most powerful instrument for changing the world. Throughout his distinguished career as a physician and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, he championed the cause of academically gifted students who lacked the financial means to pursue their potential.</p>
                <p>Following his passing, his family — led by Dr. (Mrs.) Vivian Onwubalili and their sons Dr. Emeka Onwubalili and David Onwubalili — resolved to establish a foundation that would embody his values and ensure that his vision for educational empowerment would endure for generations to come.</p>
                <p>The Foundation was registered as a dual entity: JKOF (UK) as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation in England and Wales, and JKOF (NIG) with registration number 7061941 in Nigeria. This dual structure reflects Dr. JK's own journey — from his roots in Nigeria to his distinguished career in the United Kingdom — and ensures that the Foundation can serve students in both countries.</p>
                <p>Since its establishment, the Foundation has awarded over 20 scholarships across 7 partner schools, supporting academically exceptional students who would otherwise be unable to access quality education. Each scholarship recipient carries forward Dr. JK's belief that excellence, when given the opportunity to flourish, has the power to transform not only individual lives but entire communities.</p>
